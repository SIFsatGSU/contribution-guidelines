# Websites at No Cost

### What is this?

This document explains the possible avenues, resources, and methods that staff, faculty, and students can use at GSU to host, develop, and scale different websites that you can use for projects at GSU.

This is mainly for faculty/students/staff who wish to host or develop websites with no cost, especially developers or people who wish to have a website for a variety of purposes.

#### Where can I learn how to build a website?

First stop should be the [Center for Instructional Innovation's](http://technology.gsu.edu/technology-services/it-services/training-and-learning-resources/technology-training-workshops/) Web Development workshops.

Check out [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) for other tutorials on web development. All GSU faculty/staff/students have [access to Lynda](http://technology.gsu.edu/technology-services/it-services/training-and-learning-resources/lynda-com-training/) for free.


### What's the catch?

Most of these options are mainly for development purposes and not meant for actual use in a setting with many users accessing a site (i.e. full-scale deployment).

For more information on how host your project site at full-scale, contact the [Enterprise Computing](http://technology.gsu.edu/about/) branch of IS&T.

For more information on how to use websites in a classroom setting, contact the [Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning](http://cie.gsu.edu/) at cie@gsu.edu.

**Requirements**: A Microsoft account and verification of student status.

**Instructions**: [Sign up](https://www.dreamspark.com/student/default.aspx) and verify your student status. Go to [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) to use whatever you like. Use Microsoft's [tutorial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-portal-overview/) to get started on the management portal.

**Use Case**: Can be used to create full-stack web applications and host data-driven websites all within admin-user control.

## Github Pages
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the website platform feature of [Github](https://github.com/), a code-sharing website based on the Git version control software. Create on the spot websites for either projects, organizations, or users.

**Ability**: Github Pages are static websites, meaning they deliver content as it is stored. Static websites are usually meant for presentation purposes, not for creating websites with separate users or heavy database calls.

**Requirements**: Github account.

**Instructions**: Follow [Github instructions](https://pages.github.com/). If you are a beginner, you will need to learn [Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/).

**Use Case**: Simple website making is the main utilization of Github Pages. It can be used to promote a project with various links and rich content, personal website, or even a  [blog](https://jekyllrb.com/).

> #### Github Student Developer Pack

> Github also has a [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for all students attending educational institutions. It includes free credits to a wide variety of services, including Amazon Web Servicesâ€”another Azure-type service.
