# Project Guidelines

As more and more projects are added by the Student Innovation Fellows (SIF), it is important to adhere to the following guidelines for every project.



1. **All projects are to be licensed under Creative Commons Non-Commercial 4.0.** This is the simplest way to ensure that projects become unbiased, free-to-use for everyone. Please use this [website](http://creativecommons.org/choose/) for entering specific data related to the project and pasting the html embed into the main README file of every project.

2. **Private things stay private.** Use [.gitignore](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/) files to hide certain files from being pushed to Github. This includes (but not limited to) private keys for applications, passwords, and personal information. See [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for a collection of ready to use .gitignore files. If you have questions, please email sif@gsu.edu for more details.

3. **Attribute work from other projects correctly.** Work from other projects not within GSU should be attributed to the right individual or institution. Follow the rules or the individual/institution who did the work in order to correctly attribute them.

Use these guidelines for all projects. If you have any questions, please email sif@gsu.edu
